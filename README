*Fast SPICE
This is the project to build the circuit analysis software.
Currenlty the popular circuit analysis software is ** HSPICE **, so my goal is to make a software with better time complexity than HSPICE.
So far my program can run faster than HSPICE when the number of resisters is within 1e4, and the possible improvement can be done with parallel programming.
