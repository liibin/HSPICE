# Project Title

Fast SPICE

## Getting Started

This is the project to build the circuit analysis software.
Currenlty the popular circuit analysis software is **HSPICE**, so my goal is to make a software with better time complexity than HSPICE.
So far my program can run faster than HSPICE when the number of resisters is within 1e4, and the possible improvement can be done with parallel programming.
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
